    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Gyoza (餃子, gyōza) are dumplings filled with ground meat and vegetables and wrapped in a thin dough. Also known as pot stickers,
         gyoza originated in China (where they are called jiaozi), but have become a very popular dish in Japan. It was a version brought back by Japanese soldiers returning 
         from the Japanese-backed puppet state of Manchukuo in northeastern China during World War II</p>

        <li>1 tsp ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch / corn flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gyoza wrapper</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bought from store</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dipping sauce</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Soy sauce</li>
    <li>Rice wine vinegar</li>
    <li>Chili oil (Rayu is Japanese chili oil)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the ingredients.</strong> Chop the chives and cabbage. Peel and devein the shrimp, and grate your ginger and garlic.</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li>Combine the beef, shrimp, cabbage, ginger, garlic, salt, white pepper, and the oils into a large bowl.</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li>Mix everything together well with your hands, making sure the mixture isn't lumpy or uneven. Place the bowl into the refrigerator, and then leave it for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li><strong>Take a gyoza wrapper and place a small spoonful of the mixture in the middle.</strong> Dab a little water on one half of the wrapper's edge and securely fold in two to make a semi or half circle. While folding, pinch the two sides together like a Ziploc bag and create waves while pinching. 
        Repeat this step for all the wrappers. This is called "crimping", the way to seal up the edges of the dumpling.</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li><strong>Oil and heat a skillet on the stove.</strong> Put it on medium heat and carefully drop a few dumplings into the skillet at a time, but be sure not to overload the skillet with everything.</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li>Fry the dumplings for about two minutes, then reduce the heat.</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li><strong>Add about half a cup of water to the skillet and cover it with a pan lid.</strong> Steam the dumplings until the water has evaporated or boiled off and then remove the food from the heat.</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li><strong>Place the dumplings onto a plate or serving bowl and serve with dipping sauce or soy sauce (shoyu).</strong> Gyoza dumplings are mainly served with a soy based tare sauce, 
        which you can season with rice vinegar. The dumplings are best served while still steaming hot.</li>
    </ol>
